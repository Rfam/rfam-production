# Installation
Create a python environment and install toil with cwl extras and the dependencies defined in cwl-requirements.txt. Toil currently supports python 2.7 only


Create a toil directory and create a new virtualenv **toil/venv**:  
`virtualenv â€”-python=python2.7 venv`

Activate your virtual environment by running:  
`source toil/venv/bin/activate`

Upgrade pip to the latest version:  
`pip install --upgrade pip`

Upgrade additional software:  
`pip install -U setuptools wheel ruamel.yaml==0.15.77`

Finally install and test toil by running the following:
```bash
pip install toil[cwl]
toil-cwl-runner --help
```

**NOTE: Docker / Singularity is required to run this workflow!**

# Executing the CWL workflow
To run the cwl workflow with a defined input;
Create a file test.yml using the following template:
```yml
sequences:
  class: File
  path: ./RF02567.fa
  format: http://edamontology.org/format_1929
covariance_model_database:
  class: File
  path: ../db/RF02567.cm
```
Then run:
`cwltool --singularity --out <output_directory> nc_rna_workflow.cwl test.yml`

## Executing from python script: 
Run `wrapper_scripts/process_dir.py`

## Custom docker container
A custom docker container can be built using the CWL-Dockerfile.
This will bundle all the rfam-production code into a simple python container,
which is called by many tools in cwl/tools.
