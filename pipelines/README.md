#Â Description

This folder contains the nextflow pipelines. The individual config for the pipelines are contained within their respective folders. 
The outlier to this is the `genomes` folder, in which there are a couple of older scripts. They seem to have been used to download genomes for the last update of rfamseq, but may no longer work or become obsolete, particularly if we implement a new way of doing the genome downloading. Bear this in mind for possible refactoring or deletion of scripts.
