These tracks show non-coding RNAs from the <a href="http://rfam.org/">Rfam database</a>. These tracks were created from the Rfam 14.0 covariance models (CMs), using the cmsearch program from the <a href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">Infernal</a> package. Further information about the methods used to build Rfam families can be found <a href="http://rfam.org/help">on our web page</a>.

<P><B>Methods</B></P>

<P class="indent1">
The cmsearch program was used with the --rfam, --cut_ga and --nohmmonly command line options to calculate the positions of non-coding RNAs on each genome assembly. This reproduces the method used by Rfam curators when creating each family, including the use of expertly curated thresholds for each family.
